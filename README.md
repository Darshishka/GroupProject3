## Installation for now

* run npm install in both the root folder and /client
* In the root folder, create a .env file and add DB_PASS=YOURPASSWORD
* Also in the root folder, create a .gitignore file and add node_modules
 and .env to it
 * Open mySQL workbench, open your local connection and type "CREATE DATABASE neighborhood;" and run it

 That's it, you should be able to run npm start on the root folder and everything should open up in localhost:3000
